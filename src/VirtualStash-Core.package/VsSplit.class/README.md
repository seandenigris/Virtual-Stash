I correspond to an accounting *journal entry*. I represent the details of one relevant part of a {{gtClass:VsTransaction}} e.g. *account* and *amount*. I am named following GnuCash terminology, which is perhaps a bit more colloquial.

In GnuCash, each split can have their own unique ID. We'll wait until the need arises to possibly implement this.
